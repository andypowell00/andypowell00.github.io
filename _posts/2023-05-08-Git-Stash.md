# Stashing a Specific File Before Pulling from Git  

## Introduction  

Sometimes, you need to pull the latest changes from `main`, but you have local modifications to a specific file that you donâ€™t want to lose. Instead of stashing all changes, you can **stash only a single file**, pull the latest updates, and then reapply your stashed changes safely.  

## Step 1: Stash Changes for a Specific File  

To stash changes for a single file while keeping a descriptive message, run:  

```sh
git stash push -m "Stashing myfile changes" -- path/to/myfile
```  

This command stores only the changes in `path/to/myfile` without affecting other modified files.  

## Step 2: Pull the Latest Changes  

Once the file is safely stashed, pull the latest updates from `main`:  

```sh
git pull origin main
```  

## Step 3: Reapply Stashed Changes  

After pulling, apply your stashed changes back:  

```sh
git stash pop
```  

## Alternative: Handling Stash Conflicts  

If `git stash pop` results in conflicts, use `git stash apply` instead:  

```sh
git stash apply
```  

Once everything looks good and the changes are merged properly, remove the stash manually:  

```sh
git stash drop
```  

## Helpful Commands for Managing Stashes  

### List Current Stashes  

To see all stashed changes, run:  

```sh
git stash list
```  

Example output:  

```
stash@{0}: On main: Stashing myfile changes
stash@{1}: On main: WIP before pull
```

This allows you to reference specific stashes if needed.  

### Apply a Specific Stash  

If you have multiple stashes and want to apply a specific one instead of the latest, use:  

```sh
git stash apply stash@{1}
```  

## Summary  

By following these steps, you can **safely update your local branch** without losing changes to a specific file. This approach is especially useful when working in teams to avoid unnecessary merge conflicts.
